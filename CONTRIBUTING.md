**Contributing to Exchange Rate Telegram Bot
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use Github Flow
We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github's Pull Request feature).

Here's how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

Fork the project & clone locally. Create a new branch, name it clearly.
Make your changes.
Test your changes to ensure they are correct.
Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the main branch.
At this point you're waiting on us. We'll review your changes and provide constructive feedback. If we suggest changes, make them on your branch and push to your fork, the pull request will update automatically.
**Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's an example of a bug report:

Short and descriptive example bug report title

A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

1. This is the first step
2. This is the second step
3. Further steps, etc.

<url> - a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
